# Quiz-Game
It's a simple quiz game made on Java Swing+JDBC. In which questions are popping up randomly from the Database directly.

//Software Requirements//

Any IDE will work, for example Netbeans,Eclipse etc.

A Database Management software also needed, in my case I've used Oracle 10g.


//How to find port number and host name for jdbc url ? //

Just open "my computer", browse where you have installed your Oracle and then, search for a file name as " tnsnames.ora ". 

Open it and you'll be able to know you host name and port number.


// How to compile and Run the code ? //

First open the DB Queries doc, and make all the queries running succesfully once. 

After that you can easily compile and run this code.


If you're going to use it make sure giving me credits for it :)
